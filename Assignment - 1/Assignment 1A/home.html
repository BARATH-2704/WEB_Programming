        <p>
            My name is <strong><font color="red">Barath S</font></strong>, and I am a passionate <strong><font color="orange">Computer Science</font></strong> student with a 
            strong enthusiasm for technology and problem-solving. From an early age, I have been fascinated by the 
            potential of <strong><font color="purple">programming</font></strong> and <strong><font color="blue">innovation</font></strong> to shape the future. I believe in continuous 
            learning and view challenges as opportunities for growth. My journey in the tech world has been a mix of 
            hard work, curiosity, and a commitment to making a positive impact through <em><font color="brown">innovation</font></em> and creativity.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I am skilled in programming languages such as <strong><font color="green">Python</font></strong>, <strong><font color="darkyellow">JavaScript</font></strong>, <strong><font color="red">HTML</font></strong>, 
            and <strong><font color="blue">CSS</font></strong>, along with experience in databases and server-side technologies. My goal is to become an 
            expert in <strong><font color="purple">full-stack development</font></strong> and contribute to open-source projects that drive meaningful change. 
            I thrive in collaborative environments and believe that <strong><font color="green">teamwork</font></strong> is essential to achieving great results.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Outside my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy exploring nature through <strong><font color="brown">hiking</font></strong>, reading 
            books that spark inspiration, and learning about diverse cultures through travel. These activities allow me to 
            maintain a healthy balance between work and personal life while fueling my creativity. I strongly believe that 
            every experience provides a chance to <em><font color="blue">learn</font></em> something new and valuable, helping me grow both as an individual 
            and as a future professional in the tech industry.
