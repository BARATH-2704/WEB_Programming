                Outside my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy exploring nature through <font color="#fd4f30"><b>hiking</b></font>,

                a healthy balance between work and personal life while fueling my creativity. I strongly believe that every experience provides
                a chance to <font color="#fd4f30"><b>learn</b></font> something new and valuable, helping me grow both as an individual and asa future professional in the tech industry.
