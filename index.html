        <h3>Assignment 1A:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Activity 1:</strong>
                <p>
                    Activity 1 focuses on text formatting and using images to enhance web content. In this task, I’ve designed a webpage that introduces myself, using various HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, and images. I’ve also implemented text styling techniques such as bold, italics, and emphasized text to highlight key points. This activity helps improve the understanding of HTML tags for text formatting and integrating images effectively within the webpage layout.

                <p>
                    In this section, I’ve used appropriate list elements to organize and present various data clearly. First, I’ve listed the courses for Winter 2024-2025, providing a clear outline of the subjects offered. Then, I’ve listed programming languages along with a self-assigned rating out of 10 to give insight into my proficiency in each. Finally, I’ve included reviews or summaries of my top three favorite movies, books, TV shows, or music concerts, showcasing my personal interests and reflections on these cultural experiences.

                    In this activity we will create a table and incorporate various features.
                    <ul>
                        <li>r1c1 – include any images of your choice</li>
                        <li>r1c3, r5c1, r4c1, r4c2- shades with your favourite color</li>
                        <li>r1c4, r5c3, r6c4, r5c5- include your positive affirmations (use font family, color, formatting as per choice)</li>
                        <li>r3c1- provide links to “home.html”</li>
                        <li>r2c3- Email as hyperlinks</li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Activity 4:</strong>
                <p>
                    In this activity, I explored the usage of various HTML elements to understand their behavior and differences. By comparing elements like `div` vs `span`, `div` vs `section`, and `paragraph` vs `article`, I observed how each tag is used for structuring content in different contexts. Additionally, I examined `navigation` vs `anchor`, `figure` vs `image`, and `label` vs `legends` to identify how they function in organizing content. Finally, I investigated the differences between the `strong`, `bold`, and `emphasis` tags to understand how they impact text styling.

                <p>
                    In this activity, I created a GitHub repository to upload and host all my web pages. This allowed me to share my work online and showcase my web development skills. Additionally, I prepared a video report that demonstrates how to host a website on GitHub, explaining the steps involved in setting up a repository and deploying a website using GitHub Pages.

            <li>
                <strong>Activity 6:</strong>
                <p>
                    In this activity, I designed a web page to receive user input through HTML forms. The page includes two main forms: one for sign-up details and another for sign-in. The sign-up form contains input fields for character name, email ID, and password, along with a checkbox for terms and conditions. The sign-in form allows users to log in with their credentials. I used the action attribute to link the forms to their respective destinations.

                <strong>Activity 8:</strong>
                <p>
                    In this activity, I designed a web page called 'myindex.html' that follows the principles of semantic HTML. The page includes the following sections:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Home Page - Short Descriptions about your theme.</li>
                        <li>Navigation page- include all the activities listed in assignment 1A, 1B, and 1C</li>
                        <li>Blog Page – Photos/ videos/ hyperlinks</li>
                        <li>Contact us – Add form fields for a contact us page in the footer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <a href="index_html.html">Click here to load this page</a>

        <h3>Assignment 2A:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Activity 9:</strong>
                <p>
                    In Activity 9, re-create your website from Assignment 1A using only CSS. Apply custom styles for headings, subheadings, and paragraphs with different fonts and text alignment. Use `div` elements for sections with background colors, add vertical text, and display overflow content on hover. Style images with rounded corners, drop shadows, and borders for thumbnails.

                <p>
                    In Activity 10, recreate your website from Assignment 1A (activity #2) using only CSS. List Winter 2024-2025 courses, differentiating theory and lab classes with color and font styles. For programming languages, use images as list markers and rate each out of 10.

                <p>
                    In Activity 11, recreate the website from Assignment 1A (activity #3) using only CSS for styling. Style the table by assigning height, width, and borders of your choice. Center the text within the table cells, control the spacing between content and the table border, and highlight the rows with a grey color on mouse-over. Additionally, use at least two custom CSS properties to enhance the table design.

Design the layout with appropriate selectors, and create a customized banner image for the home page. Style the navigation page and hyperlinks with various CSS properties such as color, font-family, and background. Apply CSS to style the sign-up and login pages. Utilize the box model and positioning properties to design the layout effectively. Be sure to use an external CSS file for styling the website.
