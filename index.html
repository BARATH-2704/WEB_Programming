    <ul>
        <li><strong>Activity 1:</strong></li>
        <p>
            "Activity 1 focuses on text formatting and using images to enhance web content. In this task, I’ve designed a webpage that introduces myself,
             using various HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, and images. I’ve also implemented text styling techniques such as bold, italics, and emphasized text to highlight key points.
             This activity helps improve the understanding of HTML tags for text formatting and integrating images effectively within the webpage layout."

            <p>"In this section, I’ve used appropriate list elements to organize and present various 
                data clearly. First, I’ve listed the courses for Winter 2024-2025, providing a clear 
                outline of the subjects offered. Then, I’ve listed programming languages along with a 
                self-assigned rating out of 10 to give insight into my proficiency in each. Finally, I’ve included reviews or summaries of my top three favorite movies, books, TV shows, or music concerts,
                 showcasing my personal interests and reflections on these cultural experiences." <a href="Assignment - 1/Assignment 1A/list.html" target="_blank">Click here for Actvity 2</a></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Activity 4:</strong></li>
        <p>

            "In this activity, I explored the usage of various HTML elements to understand their behavior and differences. By comparing elements like `div` vs `span`, `div` vs `section`, and `paragraph` vs `article`, I observed how each tag is used for structuring content in different contexts. Additionally, I examined `navigation` vs `anchor`, `figure` vs `image`, and `label` vs `legends` to identify how they function in organizing content. Finally, I investigated the differences between the `strong`, `bold`, and `emphasis` tags to understand how they impact text styling. Through this exercise, I 
            gained a deeper understanding of how these elements contribute to web page layout and presentation."</p>

        <li><strong>Activity 5:</strong></li>
        <p>

            "In this activity, I created a GitHub repository to upload and host all my web pages. This allowed me to share my work online and showcase my web development skills. Additionally, I prepared a video report that demonstrates how to host a website on GitHub, explaining the steps involved in setting up a repository and deploying a website using GitHub Pages. The video, which is under 3 minutes long, is embedded in my website to provide an easy-to-follow guide for others interested in web hosting. 
            This activity helped me understand the process of using GitHub for version control and web hosting."</p>

    <h3>Activity 1C:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Activity 6:</strong></li>
        <p>"In this activity, I designed a web page to receive user input through HTML forms. The page includes two main forms: one for sign-up details and another for sign-in. The sign-up form contains input fields for character name, email ID, and password, along with a checkbox for terms and conditions. The sign-in form allows users to log in with their credentials. I used the action attribute to link the forms to their respective destinations,
             ensuring smooth navigation between the sign-up and sign-in processes."</p>

        <p>"In this activity, I designed a web page called 'myindex.html' that follows the principles of semantic HTML. The page includes the following sections:
            <ul>
                <li>Home Page - Short Descriptions about your theme.</li>
